## Welcome
### My name is F. Javier Hormigos Jiménez, and this is my spot on the web to introduce my work.

### I am a software developer skilled in Python, Javascript and Go, and focused on Java. I have worked with multiple frameworks, Spring being the most prominent in recent times. Machine learning, databases (SQL and Graph, among others) and geospatial applications are some of the domains that constitute my background.
